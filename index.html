      <p>Hello! Thank you for checking out my page! My name is Ben Fondon, and I'm currently enrolled at the coding bootcamp at UT Austin.
            I've really enjoyed the challenge of learning a brand new subject, and learning technical skills that will allow me to express
            myself through a new creative outlet.</p>

      <p>Outside of class, I love hanging out with my wife and our little ones. We spend our time outside any chance we get where the kids love
            saying hello to neighborhood dogs and their owners (but mostly the dogs). We also really enjoy reading books together, family movie night,
            and general tomfoolery. When I get some alone time, I generally spend it in our garage either playing drums or working out. I also love the mountains,
            doing any hiking I can in the summer, and snowboarding in the winter.</p>

      <p>My wife and I are Texas natives who just moved to Austin after spending some time out of state. We love all the options for food and family entertainment,
            and the music scene isn't bad either. All that to say, I'm super excited about this opportunity for a significant career change, and to take part in a new
            professional and personal journey!</p>
